# Front-end Software Engineer Challenge (Weather App)

**Project target:** Create a single page application (SPA) to show the weather according to the all functional and zero or more technical requirements listed below.

Note: This shouldn't be days of work and is intentionally too large in scope. Limit yourself to a certain number of hours - say, up to four (and please if you have a situation that makes that impossible to do four hours then don't worry - do what you can and let us know both how much you were able to achieve and what requirements you dropped. We totally understand that people's time might be very much squeezed right now).

## Functional requirements

- Show weather by current location.

### Plus two or fewer of

- Implement city categorization by country name.
- Remember your favourite cities.
- Implement search by city name.
- Display weather not only on the list but on the map (Google maps).

### Data

- Get data from a free weather API. Country / city lists are up to you.
- Hint (optional): <https://www.metaweather.com/api/>

## Technical requirements

- Use a modern JavaScript framework. React or Vue.js is ideal if you have a choice of frameworks you're familiar with. If you are most comfortable with another framework then by all means use that - we might ask more questions then!
- Consider using a CSS pre-processor (Sass, Less, etc.) if you're used to using one. If they're new to you but you fancy having a go with one, that's fine too, but so is skipping this part (see the last point!).
- Consider using tools to ensure code quality.
- Ensure that the page is displayed neatly on modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox latest).
- Stretch goal (only): production code could be optimized in some way.
- The code must be placed on GitHub or BitBucket or other repo host that you can use to share via a link with us. There must be short documentation describing how to start the project.

## Guidelines for implementation

- If you're stuck or would normally ask a question about the spec simply note something as an assumption and use your judgement. Some of the spec above is intentionally vague.
- Your thoughts and decision making are of interest to us, so imagine you're reviewing your own code and decisions then add a few notes on what made you choice one direction over another. Don't feel the need to justify every decision, but choose a few you found interesting for any reason.
- If you commit the code early and often you'll demonstrate how you break down and iteratively solve problems. You might then reference specific pushes in the above. Again, this isn't essential.
- A mix between technical and functional requirements with notes is preferred over delivering exclusively functional requirements.
