# Weather App

Single page application (SPA) showing the weather according to the all functional and zero or more technical requirements listed below.

Note: This shouldn't be days of work and is intentionally too large in scope. Limit yourself to a certain number of hours - say, up to four (and please if you have a situation that makes that impossible to do four hours then don't worry - do what you can and let us know both how much you were able to achieve and what requirements you dropped. We totally understand that people's time might be very much squeezed right now).

## Functional

- Implement search by city name.
